  plan          Show changes required by the current configuration

Global options (use these before the subcommand, if any):
  -chdir=DIR    Switch to a different working directory before executing the
                given subcommand.
  -help         Show this help output, or the help for a specified subcommand.
  -version      An alias for the "version" subcommand.
root@ip-172-31-2-36:~# terraform -help plan
Usage: terraform [global options] plan [options]

  Generates a speculative execution plan, showing what actions Terraform
  would take to apply the current configuration. This command will not
  actually perform the planned actions.

  You can optionally save the plan to a file, which you can then pass to
  the "apply" command to perform exactly the actions described in the plan.

Plan Customization Options:

  The following options customize how Terraform will produce its plan. You
  can also use these options when you run "terraform apply" without passing
  it a saved plan, in order to plan and apply in a single command.

  -destroy            If set, a plan will be generated to destroy all resources
                      managed by the given configuration and state.

  -refresh=false      Skip checking for changes to remote objects while
                      creating the plan. This can potentially make planning
                      faster, but at the expense of possibly planning against
                      a stale record of the remote system state.

  -replace=resource   Force replacement of a particular resource instance using
                      its resource address. If the plan would've normally
                      produced an update or no-op action for this instance,
                      Terraform will plan to replace it instead.

  -target=resource    Limit the planning operation to only the given module,
                      resource, or resource instance and all of its
                      dependencies. You can use this option multiple times to
                      include more than one object. This is for exceptional
                      use only.

  -var 'foo=bar'      Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
                      flag can be set multiple times.

  -var-file=foo       Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
                      a file. If "terraform.tfvars" or any ".auto.tfvars"
                      files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

Other Options:

  -compact-warnings   If Terraform produces any warnings that are not
                      accompanied by errors, show them in a more compact form
                      that includes only the summary messages.

  -detailed-exitcode  Return detailed exit codes when the command exits. This
                      will change the meaning of exit codes to:
                      0 - Succeeded, diff is empty (no changes)
                      1 - Errored
                      2 - Succeeded, there is a diff

  -input=true         Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

  -lock=true          Lock the state file when locking is supported.

  -lock-timeout=0s    Duration to retry a state lock.

  -no-color           If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -out=path           Write a plan file to the given path. This can be used as
                      input to the "apply" command.

  -parallelism=n      Limit the number of concurrent operations. Defaults to 10.

  -state=statefile    A legacy option used for the local backend only. See the
                      local backend's documentation for more information.

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
